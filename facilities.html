            <h2>Bus Facility</h2>
            <p>In order to increase access to education, our school provides safe and reliable transportation services
                to students from 18 nearby villages. We operate buses each equipped with cameras and advanced safety
                features to ensure a secure commute. Our buses follow designated routes, providing convenient pick-up
                and drop-off services for students. With a focus on safety and comfort, our transportation services
                enable students to focus on their studies without worrying about daily commutes.</p>
